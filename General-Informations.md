# Protecting your e-mail adress 

## SPF 

Sender Policy Framework : checks the identity of the sender to avoid a pirate to steal the adress.

## DKIM 

Domain Keys Identified Domain, allows you to sign a mail to prove its authenticity and that it has not been modified during transfert.

## Using aliases

The idea is to create several e-mail adresses for the same mailbox. It allows you to separate your activities by adresses. 

## Using encryption systems (like PGP)

## Using a reliable provider 

Gmail is practical, fast and everything but this is a part of Google that is known to poke his nose everywhere. An efficient alternative is ProtonMail.

## Do not regroup critical informations 

If you have windows to replace in your house or flat, do not post on a forum or whatever your situation with your e-mail adress. It can be easily found and retrace your house's adress.
